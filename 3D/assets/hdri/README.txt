Place your .hdr or .exr files here.
You can reference them in 3D/config/lighting.ts.
Note: For local development, these files might need to be served via a public folder or imported explicitly.
By default, defaultLightingConfig uses an HDRI from the pmndrs/drei-assets submodule; place any additional or custom HDRIs in this folder.
